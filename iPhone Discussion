iPhone Discussion

This issue has been present for a matter of months now. It began on my iPhone 5s, and stuck around until I traded in the device with Apple and used the credit towards a mint condition iPhone 6 (no plus, no S). The issue persists on the 6, so I have a feeling it's a software problem, likely related to my backup. The issue goes like this: every 1-3 days, and sometimes as often as 3x per day, the phone will neither send nor receive SMS/iMessage, the Messages app will become unresponsive, the phone will get pretty hot - hotter than I'd ever expect it to under normal conditions, and the battery will drain rapidly. I believe the battery usage and overheating to be related, as they are symptoms of the phone trying to process something it just can't handle. I still can't explain the embargo on SMS/iMessage though. These symptoms all come as a unit, together. The only fix I've found so far (despite extensive research into the problem) is to reboot the phone. And even then, I need to wait about 10 minutes until I can access the messages app again. Then in the previously stated approximate time frame, the problem will recur. Since I haven't found a fix on my own yet, I thought to finally ask an Apple employee, to see if they have any insight on what's happening. I'm nearly sure I could solve the problem by restoring the phone from factory settings and rebuilding it from scratch, but I'd like to try and minimize collateral damage here, and only take such catastrophic measures if there's no other way to fix things. Any users come to you with this issue or anything similar?
